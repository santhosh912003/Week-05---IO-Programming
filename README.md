## ðŸ§  Overview

Week 5 covers essential real-world Java programming topics:

- *CSV/JSON Handling*: Reading, writing, and parsing structured data.  
- *Annotations*: Using metadata to enhance code behavior and readability.  
- *Reflection*: Dynamically inspecting and manipulating classes.  
- *Scenario-Based Problems*: Applying all concepts in real use cases.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered

### 01_CSVDataHandling
- Reading and writing CSV files  
- Parsing CSV data into Java objects  
- Handling headers and custom delimiters  

### 02_JSONDataHandling
- JSON parsing using *Jackson* or *Gson*  
- Serialization and deserialization of Java objects  
- Handling nested JSON structures  

### 03_Annotations
- Built-in annotations: @Override, @Deprecated, etc.  
- Creating custom annotations  
- Retention policies and runtime access  

### 04_Reflections
- Inspecting classes, fields, and methods at runtime  
- Creating objects dynamically  
- Use cases in frameworks like *Spring*  

### 05_ScenarioBasedProblem
- Real-world exercises combining:
  - I/O operations  
  - Annotations  
  - Reflection
